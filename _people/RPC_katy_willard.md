We are constantly processing sensory information to select actions and complete goals. I am interested in the computational units and circuits found across the layers of the neocortex that support this process. To explore this in my DPhil, I am combining in vivo whole-cell patch clamping and computational modelling with guidance from my two supervisors - Randy Bruno and Rui Ponte Costa.  
 
Previously, I have graduated from both an undergraduate and a master's degree at Oxford. During these degrees, I have worked in the King group studying how animals orient to sounds in space and temporal prediction in the cochlea, and in the Packer group exploring how faithfully action potentials propagate through axons.
