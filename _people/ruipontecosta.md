Rui did postdoctoral research in computational neuroscience & machine learning at﻿ the University of Oxford (UK) with Tim Vogels and briefly at the University of Bern (Switzerland) with Walter Senn. ​Previously﻿, he did his PhD (awarded in 2015) at the University of Edinburgh (UK) as part of the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation with Mark van Rossum and P. Jesper Sjöström (funded by a FCT PhD grant). During that time Rui was also a visiting PhD student at University College London (UK) and McGill University (Canada). Before that he studied computer science at the University of Coimbra (Portugal). Rui used to organise the Oxford NeuroTheory Forum (2014-2017).
