Jascha did his PhD at the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with Google DeepMind and Intel. His work focuses on efficient learning and problem solving in brains and artificial neural networks. By combining approaches from animal electrophysiology, computational neuroscience, and AI, he aims to build theories that help us to understand both biological and artificial intelligent systems. Part of his ongoing work is specifically targeting the nature of distributed computations, to show which joint principles underly the efficient and robust distributed computations in brains, large scale artificial neural networks, and modern AI hardware accelerators.
