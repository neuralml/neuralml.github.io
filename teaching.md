#### Information Processing & the Brain
_University of Bristol (2018-)_<br>
[`Github repo`](https://comsm0034.github.io/)

The brain is the most remarkable learning and information processing system that we know of. In this unit we teach information and statistical theories of the brain, different learning paradigms in neuroscience (unsupervised learning, supervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning) and advanced data analysis methods. Taught together with Conor Houghton and Cian O'Donnell.

#### Introduction to Data Science (aka SPS)
_University of Bristol (2019-)_<br>
[`Github repo`](https://uob-coms21202.github.io/COMS21202.github.io/)

â€‹This unit seeks to acquaint students with the fundamental aspects of processing digital data, presented in the context of concrete examples from applications in computer vision, graphics, speech, audio, machine learning and data mining. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of representation and modelling. Taught together with Laurence Aitchison and Majid Mirmehdi.

#### Computational Neuroscience
_University of Bristol (2018-)_<br>
[`Github repo`](https://coms30127.github.io/)

There is a growing need to describe with computational models the growing datasets that neuroscience is producing. This unit teaches the fundamentals of computational modelling in neuroscience (e.g. neuron and synaptic models). Contribute together with Conor Houghton, Cian O'Donnell and Laurence Aitchison.

 - Tutorial on modelling synaptic plasticity:

This tutorial was design to give a 1h taster session of computational modelling of synaptic plasticity for the international PhD module on Synapses, neuronal circuits and behavior (supported by FENS/IBRO-PERC) at University of Coimbra, Portugal. You can try the tutorial [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ruipontecosta/courses/master).
