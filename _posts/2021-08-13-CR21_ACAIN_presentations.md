Our group will be presenting seven posters at the [Champalimaud Symposium](https://symposium.fchampalimaud.science/), which this year focus on Dialogues on Neural and Machine Intelligence. And two talks at the [1st Advanced Online & Onsite Course & Symposium on Artificial Intelligence & Neuroscience](https://acain2021.artificial-intelligence-sas.org/). Look at for our work if you are around (or online).
