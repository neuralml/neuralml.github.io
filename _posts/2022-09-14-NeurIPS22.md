We just had two papers accepted at NeurIPS'22. First, work led by Will and Heng on a new biologically plausible and powerful model of [backprop-like credit assignment in cortical networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11769). Second, work led by Milton on [combinatorial generalisations in deep neural networks ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02283).
